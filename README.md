My name is Youssef el habchi, from [reactnativemaster.com](https://reactnativemaster.com) I welcome each and everyone of you.


Hello again, I welcome each and everyone of you. In this article, we will go through the process of making an example of react native checkbox component by building a quiz app.



Feel free to read the whole article on my blog [React Native Screen Transitions]([https://reactnativemaster.com/react-native-screen-transitions/](https://reactnativemaster.com/react-native-screen-transitions/))
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an expo project, check it from  [Expo.io](https://exp.host/@alhydra/react-native-checkbox-component-example)
